                    <dd>
                        The principle of scale refers to using relative size to signal importance and rank in a composition.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        When this principle is used properly, the most important elements in a design are bigger than the ones that are less important.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        The reason behind this principle is simple: when something is big, it’s more likely to be noticed.

                    <dd>
                        The principle of visual hierarchy refers to guiding the eye on the page so that it attends to different design elements in the order of their importance.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        A layout with a good visual hierarchy will be easily understood by your users.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Visual hierarchy controls the delivery of the experience. If you have a hard time figuring out where to look on a page, it’s more than likely that its layout is missing a clear visual hierarchy.

                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        The principle of contrast refers to the juxtaposition of visually dissimilar elements in order to convey the fact that these elements are different.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        In other words, contrast provides the eye with a noticeable difference.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        The principle of contrast is often applied through color. For example, red is frequently used in UI designs, especially on iOS, to signify deleting. The bright color signals that a red element is different from the rest.

                    <dd>
                        Gestalt principles explain how humans simplify and organize complex images that consist of many elements, by subconsciously arranging the parts into an organized system that creates a whole, rather than interpreting them as a series of disparate elements.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        In other words, Gestalt principles capture our tendency to perceive the whole as opposed to the individual elements.
