        the theory part of this module started by going over the principals of visual design. These principles are scale, scale, visual hierarchy, contrast and gestalt. These principals will be used every time you design a website. As the course went on, we learned more about how to make a website that is nice to look at and is simple to navigate. To make a website that is nice to look at you need to know how to use color to your advantage knowing which colors go together can be challenging but you will get better at matching colors together to make the website look as appealing as possible. Making the website more accessible is made in the visual studio code, the theory for the visual studio code taught us how to use HTML and CSS style sheets. Learning how to use visual studio code at first is challenging but with practice and paying attention during the lectures made it easier to understand. There is so much more than this apart of the theory, so we had to make sure we paid attention in class and practiced the new skills we learned in the theory.
